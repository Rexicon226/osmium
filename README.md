# Osmium

Python Interpreter written in Zig

ONLY works with the Python 3.10 standard. Will be expanded later, it is just easier for development now.

# Status

I work on this in my limited free time, so nothing crazy. 
**BARELY WORKS**.

# Contributing

I'm happy to review new built-in PRs, but only if it's simple. I need to understand the codebase, so I'd need to spend too much time reviewing the change if it's large. Everything is 
still super unstable and I regularly re-write large chunks of the code.
